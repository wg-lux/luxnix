multi-layered secret and credential store using Ansible Vault, Pydantic classes, and YAML-based schemas:

---

## 1. Data Modeling with Pydantic

1. Create Pydantic models for each schema category (e.g., HostConfig, GroupConfig, RoleConfig, ServiceConfig, LuxnixConfig).
2. Each model maps to a YAML file that defines its fields.
3. Use validation to ensure mandatory fields and correct formatting.

Example (host_config.py):

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class HostConfig(BaseModel):
    hostname: str
    ip_address: str
    roles: list[str]
    secrets: dict[str, str] = {}
```

---

## 2. Ansible Inventory and Vars Integration

1. For each host, role, or group, manage YAML files in host_vars, group_vars, or role_vars.
2. Store minimal references to your secrets (e.g., secret IDs, encryption layers).
3. Ansible uses these references to look up and decrypt the actual secret.

Example (host_vars/s-01.yml):

```yaml
hostname: s-01
ip_address: 172.16.255.1
roles:
  - base_server
secrets:
  admin_password: secrets/s-01.admin_password.enc
```

---

## 3. Multiple Ansible Vault Keys for Layered Access

1. Maintain vault keys for each sensitivity level (s1, s2, …, s5).
2. If a user or machine has s3 keys, they can decrypt s1–s3 secrets.
3. Each role, group, or host also has its own vault key.
4. To re-encrypt a secret for a target’s vault key, the deploying admin decrypts it locally with their permitted key and then encrypts again with the target’s key.

---

## 4. Secret Deployment Workflow

1. Admin machine unlocks secrets with the base key (e.g., s5).
2. Re-encrypt the needed secrets using the target’s vault key (e.g., s-01.key).
3. Ansible transfers the newly re-encrypted secrets to the host.
4. The target host can decrypt secrets locally (if needed) or just store them in encrypted form.

---

## 5. Command-Line Utilities (Optional)

Create Python scripts for:

1. unlock_vault: Decrypt all secrets into a secure working directory.
2. reencrypt_vault: Use the decrypted versions, pick the appropriate keys, re-encrypt for the needed target(s).
3. lock_vault: Remove all local plaintext secrets.
4. rotate_secrets: Generate new keys, re-encrypt secrets, and update references in inventory.

---

## 6. Example Setup Flow

1. Define your Pydantic schemas (Hosts, Groups, Roles, etc.) in code.
2. Create YAML files matching these schemas (e.g., host_vars/s-01.yml).
3. Store secrets in a structured directory (e.g., secrets/s-01.admin_password.enc).
4. Maintain vault keys for each layer in a secure location.
5. During deployment, decrypt with the admin’s base key → re-encrypt with the target host’s key → push to the target.

---

## 7. Advantages

• Fine-grained Access Control  
• Consistent Data Modeling and Validation  
• Automated Deployment of Layered Secrets  
• Clear Separation of Inventory and Secret Store

Following this plan ensures that you can safely manage secrets across multiple sensitivity layers, maintain modular usage of Pydantic + YAML for config data, and reuse Ansible’s built-in functionality for variable files, group_vars, host_vars, and vault encryption.

---

## Utility Functions

• generate_vault_key(key_path): Creates a new Ansible vault key file.  
• encrypt_secret(secret, key_path): Uses a vault key to encrypt the secret.  
• decrypt_secret(encrypted_secret, key_path): Decrypts the secret using the specified key.

## Using ansible-vault CLI

If ansible-vault is available, the Vault class will invoke subprocess calls:
• ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-password-file [...]
• ansible-vault decrypt --vault-password-file [...]
